This project designs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plastic waste images into predefined categories (e.g., bottles, bags). Key steps include dataset collection, preprocessing (resize, normalize, augment), model design (TensorFlow/Keras), training, evaluation, and fine-tuning using transfer learning.
